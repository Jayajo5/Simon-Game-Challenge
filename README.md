## Overview

The **Simon Game** is a simple memory-based color sequence game. A new color is added each level, and the player must repeat the entire sequence correctly. It's a great project to practice **event handling**, **animations**, **timing**, and **logic** using **jQuery**.

## My process

1. Setup basic HTML layout with 4 colored buttons.
2. Styled using CSS for visual feedback (pressed).
3. Used **jQuery** for:
   - DOM manipulation
   - Click and keydown events
   - Playing sounds
   - Managing game logic and sequences
4. Added game reset and level tracking.

### Built with
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- jQuery  
- Sound effects (MP3 files)

### What I learned
- Handling user input using `keydown()` and `click()` events in jQuery
- How to use arrays to track game and user patterns
- Managing game states (start, in-progress, game over)
- Creating interactive UI animations using `.addClass()` and `.removeClass()`

### Continued development

In future versions, I‚Äôd like to:
- Add touch support for mobile
- Track and display high scores using `localStorage`
- Add difficulty levels or speed changes
- Improve visual feedback with animations
